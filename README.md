# NBA Top 5 Players' Salary Insurance Premium Pricing
NBA Salary Insurance Premium Pricing Model

This actuarial project models and prices salary insurance premiums for the top 5 highest-paid NBA players on each team, based on the probability that they miss 41 or more games due to injury in a single season. The policy covers career-impacting or season-ending injuries, and will pay 80% of a player's salary per game missed after 41 consecutive games due to injury.

ðŸ“¥ Data Collection

Manually gathered from multiple public sources, the dataset includes player-specific data such as:

Team affiliation

Age

Weight

Position

Contract duration and salary

Historical games played and missed

Injury history (including need for surgery)

Data was cleaned and entered into Excel for modeling purposes.

ðŸ“Š Variables & Key Formulas

Injury Projection

To estimate the expected games missed, I calculated:

Career missed games and missed games over the last 2 seasons

Weighted average to estimate next season's expected missed games

Injury % = Expected missed games / 82

Adjusted for season-ending injuries using conditional probability:

~61% of NBA players get injured per year

~10% of those have season-ending injuries (41+ missed games)

Conditional Probability = 10% / 61% â‰ˆ 16.39%

Final Season-Ending Injury % = Injury % Ã— 0.1639

Expected Loss

expected_loss = annual_salary Ã— salary_coverage Ã— probability_41+_games

Where salary coverage = 0.80, based on policy payout rules (80% of salary per game missed).

Premium Formula

premium = [expected_loss / (1 + i)] Ã— age_factor Ã— contract_factor Ã— position_factor Ã— injury_factor Ã— (1 + risk_load) Ã— (1 + admin_load)

Where:

i = 3% (interest rate used to discount present value)

Risk Load = 25% (conservative buffer for volatility and profit)

Admin Load = 5% (expenses, overhead)

Age

<25 = 0.8; 25â€“29 = 1.0; 30â€“34 = 1.3; 35+ = 1.7

Moderate Injury (No Surgery)

Tendinitis, muscle strains

Moderate Injury (With Surgery)

Major Lower Body Injury

ACL, Achilles, patellar tendon

1.5

Career-threatening risk

Multiple Major Injuries

ACL + Achilles combo

1.7

Significantly elevated risk

Recent Major Injury (<12 mo)

Return from ACL/Achilles

âœ… Premium Validation

ðŸ“ˆ Premium % of Salary

After calculating the final premium for each player, I divided it by their salary:

premium_rate = premium / annual_salary

Average Premium Rate: 5.72%

âœ… Matches the real-world range of 4â€“7% for NBA salary insurance

ðŸ“‰ Loss Ratio Analysis

loss_ratio = expected_loss / premium

Average Loss Ratio: 0.47

While slightly lower than the 70â€“80% typical range, this is acceptable given:

Limited player-level data

High claim volatility

Large per-game salary payouts and need for conservatism

ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways

ðŸ”Ž Manual player-level data sourcing ensures personalized risk assessment

ðŸ§® Factor-based actuarial pricing mirrors real-world underwriting

âœ… Premiums and loss ratios align with professional benchmarks

ðŸ’¡ Can be extended to simulate real insurance portfolios, sensitivity testing, or reinsurance layers
