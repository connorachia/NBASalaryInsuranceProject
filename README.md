# NBA Salary Insurance Pricing Model

This actuarial project calculates salary insurance premiums for the top 5 players on each NBA team, covering the risk of a player missing **41 or more consecutive games** due to injury. The insurance policy is structured to **pay 80% of the player's salary per game missed** beyond that threshold.

---

## üìå Objective

The goal is to simulate the actuarial pricing of career-impacting injury insurance using real player data, industry-based assumptions, and probabilistic modeling. This project replicates real-world practices insurers might follow when underwriting contracts for professional athletes.

---

## üî¢ Data Collection

Manually gathered data for each player includes:

- Team
- Age (as of the 2025‚Äì26 season)
- Years remaining on contract
- Position
- Weight
- Previous injuries (type + surgery status)
- Games played
- Games missed over career and last 2 seasons

Sources include NBA.com, ESPN, Spotrac, and Basketball Reference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. **Injury Percentage Estimation**
- Calculated a **weighted average** of games missed (career + recent seasons)
- Divided by 82 to estimate expected games missed next season
- Adjusted using the conditional probability of **missing 41+ games**:
  - ~61% of players get injured each season
  - ~10% of those suffer season-ending or 41+ game injuries
  - So: `P(41+ games | injury) = 10% / 61%`

### 2. **Expected Loss Calculation**
```excel
Expected_Loss = Injury_Prob_41plus √ó Annual Salary √ó 80%
```

### 3. **Premium Calculation**
```excel
Present_Value_Loss = Expected_Loss / (1 + i), where i = 3% interest
premium = [expected_loss / (1 + i)] √ó age_factor √ó contract_factor √ó position_factor √ó injury_factor √ó (1 + risk_load) √ó (1 + admin_load)
```

### 4. **Final Premium as % of Salary**
```excel
Premium % = Premium / Annual Salary
```

## üìà Assumptions

### üîπ Risk & Admin Loadings
| Type           | Value | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Risk Loading   | 25%   | To buffer against volatility and adverse selection |
| Admin Loading  | 5%    | To cover underwriting and administrative expenses |

### üîπ Multiplicative Rating Factors

| Variable         | Factor Logic |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Age Factor**   | <25 = 0.8, 25‚Äì29 = 1.0, 30‚Äì34 = 1.3, 35+ = 1.7 |
| **Contract Factor** | 1 yr = 0.9, 2+ yrs = 1.1 |
| **Position Factor** | Centers (C) = 1.2; all others = 1.0 |
| **Injury Factor**   | See detailed criteria below |

### ü©∫ Injury Factor Criteria

| Injury Type                      | Examples                            | Factor | Rationale |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| No Injury History                | ‚Äî                                   | 0.9    | Strong durability |
| Minor Injury (No Surgery)       | Mild sprains, contusions            | 1.0    | Baseline |
| Moderate (Recurring, No Surgery)| Tendinitis, strains                 | 1.2    | Recurrence risk |
| Moderate (Surgical)             | Meniscus repair, hand surgery       | 1.3    | Downtime but recovery |
| Major Lower Body Injury         | ACL, Achilles, patellar tendon      | 1.5    | Career-altering |
| Multiple Major Injuries         | ACL + Achilles, etc.                | 1.7    | Elevated long-term risk |
| Recent Major Injury             | Within past 12 months               | 1.6‚Äì1.8| Incomplete recovery risk |
| Chronic Condition               | Back/knee degeneration              | 1.6    | Red flag for insurers |

## ‚úÖ Results

- **Average Premium % of Salary:** 5.72%
- **Real-world Benchmark:** Salary insurance typically costs 4‚Äì7% of annual salary
- **Average Loss Ratio**: **0.47**

### üìâ Loss Ratio Validation
Loss Ratio = Expected Loss / Premium  
While industry target is ~70‚Äì80%, a lower value reflects:
- Conservative pricing for high-severity, low-frequency risk
- Incomplete historical injury exposure data
- Tailored pricing due to lack of large-sample NBA insurance studies

## Project Difficulties and Solutions
Problem #1: The data did not account for playoff games and only regular season games. 

Solution: The maximum amount of playoff games (including the NBA play-in games) is 30 games. This number is greatly reduced as many teams do not make it to the NBA Finals and also each playoff series rarely makes it to seven games, thus the playoff games played by each NBA player are significantly reduced. With playoff games being only a small percentage of games played, the injury percentage will only experience a small change that will not significantly affect the premium. If this change is desired to be explored in future projects, one can calculate the probability each player will make the playoffs and also the expected amount of games played. One can then either add a playoff loading factor to the premium formula or add directly to the amount of games played in a season (including playoffs) to calculate a new injury percentage.

Problem #2: The data does not take into account DNP's (Did Not Play) as the data provided doesn't have an explanation on why each NBA missed certain games. 

Solution: This problem only has a marginal effect on premiums as most players within the top five don't get too many DNP's. Most of their DNP's occur during the beginning of their careers because rookies tend to be played less, but a solution was developed by using a weighted average for the amount of games missed per season (60% for overall carreer, which is the portion afffected by early career DNP's and 40% past two season, which have little to no DNP's). 

Problem #3: Data for players with only one season played was being incorrectly displayed.

Solution: Because the weighted average for games missed relied on at least two or more seasons played, the premium for players with only one season played was incorrect. This was corrected by adjusting the 40% part of the weighted average for games missed by multiplying games missed within last two season by two in order not to mess up this weighted average.
